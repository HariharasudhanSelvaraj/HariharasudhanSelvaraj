I am Hariharasudhan, pursuing BA (HONS) Economics at Madras school of Economics (MSE). I am exploring the fields of finance and Deep learning. Particularly, interested in how stable distrbutions aid in devloping better risk and investment models. Similarly, exploring the ways of implemnting Reinforcement learning (RL) into the space of trading.

In my free time, I enjoy watching anime and movies. I also like playing playsataion (fav: Uncharted series). Also feel free to check my blog during my high School; I wrote about Theory of Knowledge (TOK) and fun activities I did (poster making, cooking, stock market competition experiences).
